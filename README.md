Demo

Requirements
------------------

A browser capable of parsing the ES6 specifications of the JavaScript language, such as Google Chrome, is required.

Known Issues
------------------

There is subtle glitch in which the player can move the snake in the direct parallel direction instead of orthogonal directions. This requires pressing multiple directions at a faster rate than that which the game runs. When I have time, I can add a simple keystopper variable to prevent this.
