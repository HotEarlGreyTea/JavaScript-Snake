Demo
------------------

To play the game, download the repository to a local folder and open snake.html.

Known Issues
------------------

Will require a browser capable of parsing the ES6 specifications of the JavaScript language, such as Google Chrome.

There is subtle glitch in which the player can move the snake in the direct opposite direction instead of orthogonal directions. This requires pressing multiple directions at a faster rate than that which the game runs. When I have time, I can add a simple keystopper variable.
